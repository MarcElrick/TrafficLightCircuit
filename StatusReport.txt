Both Controller 1 and Controller 2 compile and function as intended.

To develop the two versions, we first designed the circuits. This was done using
the website CircuitVerse, where we could collaborate together. After this, it
became a matter of implementing the existing design in Hydra code.

To test the Controller 1 circuit. The driver tests the 'normal use' as named in the
specification, where there is a high reset signal to begin with, before the
circuit runs the traffic light cycle (This test is labelled
Controller1TestData1). In non-normal cases where the reset button is pressed,
after the next clock-tick the traffic lights will return to green at the
beginning of the sequence (Test: Controller1TestData2).

Controller 2 left some design decisions up to us, one of which was 'what would
happen if the walkRequest button is pressed during the red/walk state?'. We
decided to effectively ignore any walkRequest in non-green/wait states. The
counter also would not increment in these cases. This is because, imagining in a
real scenario, someone may decide to press the request button multiple times in
a row which would not add helpful information to the counter, and the
amber/red/amber cycle should not be interrupted and restarted.

Although it wasn't explicitly mentioned in the specification, another decision
we made was to have the Reset button immediately return the lights to the
green/wait state alongside resetting the walkCount to 0 as the green/wait state
is the default state of the circuit.

There is also commentary within the source program and driver.
